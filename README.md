Goal: Generate NFTs that each contain a list of 5 token investments. Users can mint as many as they want; Assuming that each NFT has “invested” the same amount of money into its listed tokens upon mint, check back in __ weeks time to discover which address holds the NFTs with the highest valued portfolio. Can do this with an oracle to make it even more fun + decentralized. Reserve a certain % of the mint pool to go towards the winner.
